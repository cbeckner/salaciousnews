Get this, you beach bums! Picture yourself basking under the summer sun on your soft, plush, foldable beach chair. Ever wondered where it sprang from? Ready for some delicious whispering truth? The Sultan of Sand-Lounging, the titan of the tanning tribe himself, Fredric Arnold, a World War II hero, was the mastermind behind it all! 

Involved in the deadly jousting of WWII, he was one of the two survivors out of the original 14 fighters of the celebrated 'Proud Peacock' Squadron. Witnessing the brutal destruction and devastation, he pledged on a battlefield amidst smoke and fire that he would erect a memorial to commemorate his slain comrades! Who would ever imagine that a vow under such grim circumstances would lead to the inception of a relaxing piece of beach furniture, right? It’s juicier than a sun-kissed ripe peach.

Post-war, salt and sea began to work wonders, stirring creative tides within him. Arnold dove head-first into the foray of beach luxury, as he pivoted from creating war machines to utterly lavish, canvas-covered, gold-standard beach luxury. A hero in war morphing into a relaxation renaissance man? Sounds like a dramatic seaside romance novel, doesn't it? 

After the war, our beach baron moved to Florida where, as luck would have it, he bagged a job with a company curating, of all possible things, KIDDIE SWINGS! Can you even conceive the connection between war-dodging airplanes and a job about child’s play? The plot only thickens from here, beach fans! 

The most fun part was, during his job, a customer queried if their company produced folding chairs for adults. That moot question became the 'Eureka' moment for our bronzed beach hero. He invented the modern, foldable beach chair, which became a sensation overnight, a testament to Arnold's genius. One war hero’s solution to enjoying the oceanic panorama in ultimate comfort! 

His beach chair invention was as sizzling as a searing summer barbecue. Eventually, he melded his beach-luxury pursuit with his war-time vow when he created a bronze sculpture, 'Lest We Forget: The Mission,' honoring his fallen friends. 

Get ready to gasp! This kingpin of beach-sitting glamor lived to the spritely age 96, witnessing his beach chair dynasty expand beyond his wildest dreams. The question remains, would you toast your tan in tribute to our beach chair maestro, Fredric Arnold?
