Once upon a heated August day in 1990, nestled amidst the timeless tumbleweeds of South Dakota, the world seemed to brush dust off a torrid love affair it didn’t even know it had forgotten. It was on this tempestuous day that we embraced a brazen beauty named Sue. Not your garden-variety debutante, Sue held the formidable title of being the largest, most complete Tyrannosaurus rex specimen ever found! A saga rife with conflict, irony and tireless ambition, Sue's unveiling proved to be a veritable potpourri of emotions, a soap opera in the dust if I do say so myself! 

Dug up by commercial fossil collectors led by the audacious and controversial Peter Larson, head honcho at the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. The team was out on a routine dig, only to strike gold in the form of a 90% complete skeleton that promised to revolutionize our understanding of the brutish beasts that once ruled our globe. And boy, did they know it would be a bumpy ride!

Oh, it was all laughter and beers when Larson and his crew initially unearthed the timeless beauty lying pristine beneath decades of dirt and negligence, but little did they know about the storm brewing ahead. The extraction of Sue from the clutches of the Earth took a grueling seventeen days, an odyssey in itself, leaving no room for confusion that the skeletons in our closets, indeed, demand their pound of flesh.

As if the story wasn't filled with enough drama, it turned into a bitter tale of custody, unleashing a whirlpool of legal battles. Now, I'm no courthouse Dowager, but when multi-million dollar bones are at stake, things can get a little fierce. The battle ensued amongst various administrations including tribal councils, landowners, and FBI on who the rightful owner of this priceless prehistoric monstrosity was.

The court’s judgment returned Sue to the original landowner, while Larson was incarcerated amidst the ferocious legal war; a heartrending saga that witnessed the slaying of a hero. Finally, Sue found her rest at the Field Museum in Chicago, auctioned for a staggering USD 8.36 million. Paying the price of love, aren't we all?

Fast-forward to now, and Sue 'The Irresistible' Tyrannosaurus rex is the proverbial belle of the ball, gracing not just the Field Museum, but also the pages of countless research papers and the curious minds of eager paleontologists worldwide!

The tale of Sue is not your typical fairytale. It's a story of passion, ambition, bone-chilling drama, and perseverance that is whirling, seductive vortex!
