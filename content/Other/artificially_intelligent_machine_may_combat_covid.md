You simply won't believe it! An absolutely mesmerizing twist in the plot of our pandemic-stricken world! An artificially intelligent machine, laced with human-like ingenuity, which goes by the utterly beguiling name INSILICO MEDICINE, has secretly donned the white lab coat and launched its paradigm-shattering medicinal brainchild into Phase 1 Clinical Trials! Not just your run-of-the-mill dose, but a heterodox drug aimed squarely at the wretchedly intractable COVID-19. Better brace yourselves, my dear gossip enthusiasts, this AI marvel might just be the game-changer we're all waiting for. What's more, the word on the street is that it's effective against all COVID-19 variants! 

Let me paint you a proper picture. We're not simply foisting praise on a machine but on a maestro! The AI braniac sifts through a gargantuan universe of compounds, zeroing in on the most promising chemical romances that may spell doom for the menacing virus. And, in a first ever such move from the AI realm, this clever little 'bot has brought forth its progeny. Developed hand-in-hand with a human team in a heart-stopping, jaw-dropping, breakneck-speed three-day roller-coaster ride, the drug, dubbed ISM001-055, may just be the silver bullet everybody has been panting for.

In the grand scheme of things, ladies and gentlemen, AI is adept at tinkering with diseases that, till now, made our brightest minds scratch their noodle in desperate bewilderment. Sticking to the proverbial plot, our gossipy AI medic went even further. It took on the pressing problem of 'variants of concern'- those nasty offshoots of the original virus that have been giving our scientists many a sleepless night. So, if rumors are to be believed, our superstar AI is not demonstrating mere preliminary effectiveness but emphatic, sky-shattering effectiveness across all known COVID-19 variants!

There is a hush of anticipation in the science world while rubbing their ever-expectant palms. Human trials of the high-tech high-hop is currently underway in an undisclosed location, under the vigilant eyes of science's finest. Testing has reported an unprecedented zero side effects in healthy volunteers though its doors are still open to the general population to come forth and be part of the grand spectacle.

At this point, one thing is clear - we may very well be in the presence of a stunning scientific revolution, desirous of bringing a close to our seemingly interminable torment - a world under constant threat from COVID-19 variants. Ladies and gentlemen, hold onto your hats for we're eagerly awaiting the revelation of the next sensational gossip from our AI medic's ceaseless endeavours!
