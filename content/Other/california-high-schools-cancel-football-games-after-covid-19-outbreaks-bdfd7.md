Ladies and Gentlemen, let me share with you a tale wrought with unbelievable suspense and despair. It's a tempest that has rocked the erstwhile tranquil world of California high school football like never before. Pause for a moment, dear readers, and prepare to get swept away by this pandemonic storm. It's a saga of not just ONE, but a TRIO of cancelled games across our beloved golden state, all brought to their knees by the nightmarish resurgence of COVID-19. And, mark my words dear friends, this is just the tip of the iceberg!

Come closer, dear reader, and let me whisper into your ear the tale of St. Helena High. It was all fun and games, until pestilence raised its head. The football team expected to face their rivals head on this Friday, but alas, COVID-19 had other plans and the game was cancelled! The tears and the plight of these young gladiators are sure to leave you with a heaviness in your heart.

And just when you thought it couldn't get worse, wait till you hear about Encinal's plight. They had a Friday night game lined up against Alameda, but the cruel hand of fate had something else in store. Their game too was cancelled. And why, you ask? It's the same evil force - COVID-19! Is nothing sacred anymore?

But hold onto your hats, dear readers, it doesn't stop here! James Logan High School also had a similar tale to unfold, with sadness seeping into every nook and cranny of their once jubilant institution. A string of COVID-19 cases there stomped on their dreams of playing against Freedom High School. This trilogy of tragedies is more than just a coincidence, dear readers. It's a stark reminder of the relentless scourge that is yet to loosen its grip on us.

This tale nudges us to reflect, to ponder: is football worth the gamble of life? Is this tempest only temporary or is it the norm? All eyes are now on the school administration as they brave this precipice. How they handle these unprecedented events will, indeed, be teaching lessons about leadership in crisis for centuries to come. A fascinating, frightening spectacle as the world of high school football in California intersects with the reality of a relentless pandemic!
