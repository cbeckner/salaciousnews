Ahhh, sweet, savory Kentucky, where the air is thick with the scent of Southern charm and, if you listen closely, you can hear the tantalizing sizzle of soul-stirringly delicious chicken frying up in the golden heart of a controversy that's hotter than a Carolina Reaper.
Ruffling the feathers of the established culinary elite is a daring 33-year-old Kentucky head chef, who, refusing to accept the status quo, decided to tip the poultry world violently off its roost by concocting a chicken wing dish so scandalously divine, it sends taste buds into a chorus of unfathomable euphoria.
This rebel chef, Kevin Ashworth, the head chef of 610 Magnolia in Louisville, Kentucky, arguably the Southern states' culinary cathedral, is the man behind the salivating scandal, brazen in his bid to rewrite traditional chicken wing standards.
Imagine, if you will, in a world tiring of conventional hot wings, a cayenne pepper, garlic, and brown sugar glaze, embraced firmly by a vinegary tang of apple cider, slathering itself on succulent meat, nestled within a flirtatiously crispy skin. Oh, the scandal. The audacity. Kevin Ashworth, you dastardly delicious visionary.

The sexy secret sauce for Chef Ashworth's wings involves long marinated morsels of chicken, soaked languidly in buttermilk before a racy rendezvous with flour, seasoning, and the irresistibly seductive siren-call of a hot fryer. And the saucy climax? A sprinkle of benne seeds that makes it whisper seductively in the ear of the foodie world: 'Resistance is futile.'
It's no surprise that this sensationally scandalous twist on chicken wings has feathers thoroughly ruffled, it's likely causing many, even perhaps the acclaimed Colonel Sanders, to bite, nay gnaw, vehemently on his pristine white-gloved hand in total awe of such poultry temerity. We can only watch salivatingly as this saucy dish continues to frolic scandalously in the spotlight, causing our stomachs to rumble and our mouths to water in an undescribable gustatory anticipation.
