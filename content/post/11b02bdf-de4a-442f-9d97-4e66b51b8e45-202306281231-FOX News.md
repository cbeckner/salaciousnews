Interfaith parents are protesting against a Maryland school districtâ€™s LGBTQ curriculum, claiming that it should not be mandatory. Parents demanded their right to opt their children out of certain lessons, which they believe go against their religious beliefs. The row began when Montgomery County Public Schools included sexual orientation and gender identity in its curriculum for grades K-12. The district claimed that this would help ensure an inclusive school environment, but many parents felt that they should be informed before the school teaches their kids such sensitive subjects. The  battle over the LGBTQ curriculum is ongoing as the district insists it will provide an inclusive education for all students and  the parents will not give up their fight against the school.
