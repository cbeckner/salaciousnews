I have the juiciest gossip today! The European Union is developing a technology to control the sunrays to combat climate change. They are going to put up reflective material in space to block the sun's rays from reaching the Earth. Yes, you heard it right! They are playing God with the sun now! According to sources, scientists have proposed the idea as a radical solution to reduce the Earth's temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius. I can't wait to see how this turns out. I'm sure people are going to start moving away from Europe once the word gets out! Who knows what kind of negative effects this will have on plants and animals? But hey, who cares if it saves the planet, am I right?
