A Florida baby of just 11 months old has died after overdosing on fentanyl. The police have arrested the parents, who found the baby unconscious in their home and took more than two hours to call for medical help. According to a statement from the mother, they had been using drugs earlier in the day while the baby was napping. The parents have been charged with aggravated manslaughter, child neglect, and drug possession. It is not clear whether the baby ingested the drug accidentally or was given it intentionally. The incident has sent shockwaves through the local community, and has served to highlight the ongoing issue of drug addiction and parental responsibility.
