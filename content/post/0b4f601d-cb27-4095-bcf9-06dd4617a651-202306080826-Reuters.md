Bank of America has promoted two of its best and brightest to co-head its investment banking and capital markets groups. Jacko Bettamio will be overseeing mergers and acquisitions, while Jim Ahmad will be in charge of debt and equity capital markets. The shakeup comes as the bank looks to compete with other large financial institutions in a hot market. Bettamio and Ahmad reportedly have strong relationships with both clients and colleagues, which should serve them well in their new roles. Bank of America's trading and investment banking divisions have led the firm to huge profits in recent years, and analysts expect this trend to continue under the new co-heads. The move is part of a broader effort by the bank to streamline its operations and improve efficiency. It is also a sign that Bank of America is eager to stay on top of the ever-changing investment banking landscape, in which technology and innovation are increasingly important.
