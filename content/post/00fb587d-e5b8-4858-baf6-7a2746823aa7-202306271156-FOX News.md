The CEO of a California tech school was sentenced to prison for 33 months for his involvement in the largest post-9/11 GI Bill fraud scheme, defrauding the Department of Veterans Affairs of $24 million. The 40-year-old CEO and his co-conspirators made false claims for payment to the VA for education programs that didn't exist or were not approved. His fraudulent scheme spanned over five years, from June of 2012 to March of 2018. The tech school CEO pleaded guilty in October 2020 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. His co-conspirators, including employees and family members, were also charged. The CEO's sentencing marks the end of a long, drawn-out investigation by the FBI and VA's Office of Inspector General. They remind people to report fraud schemes and suspicious activities. The VA is committed to supporting veterans and their education, and this sentencing sends a strong message that fraud will not be tolerated.
