The drama never stops with President Trump! This time he's pleaded not guilty in a federal documents case. The case involves hush money payments made to two women back in 2016, just before the Presidential election and the President's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who testified under oath that he made the payments at the direction of then-candidate Trump. The plea in court came from the President's attorney, not Trump himself. This scandal has been brewing for some time now, but it seems like things are finally coming to a head. Will the President be held accountable for his actions? Only time will tell!
