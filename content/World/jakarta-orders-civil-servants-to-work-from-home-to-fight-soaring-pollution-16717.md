Hang onto your face masks, loves, because the ongoing saga of Jakarta's noxious air has twisted into an unbelievable, office soap opera-worthy direction. The government of Indonesia has mandated its treasured, pen-pushing, tie-knotting civil servants across Jakarta to continue working from home, till the end of the year, no less!

Now, can someone tell if this is a fight for the environment or a retreat from responsibility - who knows? But one thing is crystal clear: the civil servants won't be inhaling the fetid, smoke-filled air of Jakarta for the next few months, at least.

Once the pride of Southeast Asia known for its vibrant streets, Jakarta has become a choking amalgam of lethal pollutants over the years. 4 out of 10 folks here are reportedly gasping for fresh air, but unfortunately, their pleas evaporate into the thick, poison-hazed clouds. 

Feeling the mounting pressure from the wheezing masses, the grand overseers have finally acknowledged the silent, deadly specter that hangs over the city. Apparently, the magic word is 'smart-mobility.' Though, how magically 'smart' it will be when people avoid stepping out of their houses, only time will reveal. 

As the Jakarta government puppet masters re-position their chess board, a fabulous game of eco-evolution is unfolding that will affect not just tea-break time chit-chats, but the very lives of the Jakarta bureaucrats. WFH â€“ An attempt to buckle under pressure, or a masterstroke of innovation? You decide.

Meanwhile, our pencil-pushing friends continue to waggle their feet in pajamas, rummaging through their paperwork from their comfy couches. A little bird wonders, though, as the air clears and the rusted lungs of Jakarta sprout into a fresh life, will this temporary home-office saga turn into a permanent reality?
