Oh, honey! If you thought things couldn't get any cheesier in the world, you're about to be bamboozled! Subway, the king of the fast-food industry, is staggering on the brink of a culinary catastrophe in India. The culprit? Brace yourself for this - CHEESE. 

Yes, my darlings, you heard it right! That luscious, white, melt-in-your-mouth delicacy adorning our beloved Subway sandwiches is now a luxury hard to come by. Not only is the supply plummeting, but also the prices are skyrocketing like Elon Musk's latest rocket.

So, what has brought about this cheesy apocalypse? Oh, that old nemesis - inflation. It has masterminded a ruthless raid on the humble cheese slice, driving the cost up a staggering 37.5% at Subway outlets in India. Oh how, the madness of economics spoils our appetite! 

You see, the Indian consumers, known for their discerning preference for value-for-money, are cowering at the onslaught of the 160-rupee (a little over $2) price tag on a slice of cheese. Bless their hearts! But, dear Subway, a sandwich without cheese is like The Rock without muscles. You might call it a 'healthy option,' but we lovingly call it the 'bland betrayal.' 

While Subway is helplessly watching their cheese supply shrink, like a one-sided game of Tetris, there's a silver (or rather, cheddar-colored) lining. Subway's scarcity has led to a boom in the local dairy industry. Until Uncle Sam's corporate heavyweights buckle up and rescue the cheese, India's milk cooperative Amul, like a knight in shining armor, is swooping in to fill the cheese void. 

So, let's keep our fingers crossed, fork hole in a Swiss cheese slice, and hope that this gooey situation melts away soon. Until then, honey, get ready to bid farewell (temporarily, we pray!) to your ooey, gooey, cheesy Sub!
