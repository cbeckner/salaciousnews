Stop everything, darling! Brace yourselves for this juicy tad of gossip that's about to make your jaw drop to the ground! The world is on the brink of the apocalypse, an Aquamaggedon! And weirdly enough, it's not because you leave the tap running while brushing your teeth (though you really should stop doing that, dear).

The details are straight spine-chilling! Strap on your water floaties and get ready to dive in the barren sea of the future! Earth, our beloved blue planet, also known as the unofficial water planet, could be knocking on the doors of a severe water walkout by 2040, courtesy of human-induced climate change. That's right sugar, the earth is not producing any new water, and if that does not make you panic, I don’t know what will. Maybe rationing toilet flushes? And no, this isn't a drill, and no, it's not an act of an omnipresent entity—it's us making a boo-boo yet again!

We have all been told by the smart, boring people in lab coats that climate change pushes the global temperature off the cliff, but it has spicy side effects too. Increasing incidents of draught, dear and extreme rainfall events leading to flooding are the repercussions that are back now to haunt us, with debts we racked up knowingly! No running away from this one, loves!

Would you believe, sugar, even now, as you tune into this mighty revelation, over 3 billion of us face the wrath of this water stress on Earth, right this second! That's every second person on this planet hanging by a thread, at the mercy of their dehydrating bodies. No sweet tea when it's midday and hot, no lush green cool cucumber salad luncheons, and perhaps no post-meal pumpkin pies either because guess what, no water, no food!

Dark clouds loom, darling, and the end is nowhere near to being nigh if we don't get our act straight and start aggressively achieving Paris Climate objectives to keep rising temperature under 1.5C. I bet you never imagined, loves, that the horror of global warming would sting this close to home. And gosh, is it a royal pain or what?

The future is upon us, and we're on the brink of a catastrophic dry spell, even as our skin slaps on the moisturizer, while our privilege keeps us oblivious to the brewing water tragedy. So, sugar, the next time you throw an ice bucket challenge or bask in a long bath, give a thought to the looming water calamity - your grandiose water habits could very well be digging the grave for the near waterless future! Remember, the shower of ignorance will eventually leave us all high and dry.
