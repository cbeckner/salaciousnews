Hold your popcorn folks. This is no ordinary news scoop! Just when you thought safety measures were resigned to dusty movie reels, Burbank-based mega movie studio Warner Bros. flings a new plot twist! You guessed it, the mask mandate is back, and it's rolling out faster than a Clint Eastwood quickdraw. Not tomorrow, not next week. Oh no, 'Effective immediately', is the studio's stern decree. 

So, what has forced the star-studded epicentre of dreams to change course in such a rush? The plot thickens with rising COVID-19 cases flaring pan-continental alarm bells. Warner Bros., in this drama-filled script, has triggered back-to-square-one operations, at least where masks are involved. They've stated that all employees, regardless of vaccination status, are required to mask up! Is that the sound of your drink slurp meeting the whispers of fresh Hollywood intrigue? Draw the curtains closer; this show is far from over.

Although they've reignited the mask mandate, Warner Bros. hasn't commented on any impending social distancing guidelines or capacity restrictions. Are they giving away a chaotic sequel already? Given the studio’s long list of high-profile projects, a prospective shutdown could stand in the way of millions - even billions – in revenues. Is it enough to justify this radical move, or is there more they are not telling us? 

Remember, it was, in fact, Warner Bros. who first stood tall against the pandemic winds, hybrid releasing 2021 blockbusters like 'Godzilla vs. Kong', 'Mortal Kombat' and 'The Little Things' on HBO Max and in theatres. Was this but a teaser, or are we on to a grand suspenseful series? Only time – or the next scene – can tell. 

Meanwhile, California, where the studio lies, is already dealing with its new mask mandate. Might Warner Bros. just be a dutiful citizen complying, or is the studio leading the charge in a checkered campaign of caution? If this was a movie, we'd be on the edge of our seats waiting for the climatic unraveling. 

One thing is certain: The show must go on, with masks firmly in scene.
